# Debian-based install

Debian-based systems will require a specific package extension and instructions. FIM is designed to install and work with the provided `deb` extension package. You can install FIM in Debian systems with the following required steps:

1. Download the Debian package from [Releases page](https://github.com/Achiefs/fim/releases) 
2. Run from a terminal `dpkg -i fim*.deb` to install the package.
3. Start FIM software with `systemctl start fim`.

From this point, FIM will start to work with the default configuration. It will report each event detected to a local JSON file. The location of the file is `/var/lib/fim/events.json`.

If you detect some problem in FIM performance, you could retrieve the process log from `/var/log/fim/fim.log`.

> Available commands in systemctl [start, stop, restart, status].

> If you wish to tune up FIM, take a look at [Configuration file]({% link docs/configuration-file.md %})

# Testing FIM events

After starting FIM, it will produce events detected by your host. You may want to generate a testing event to check all is working right in your environment.

*Produce event in FIM Linux*
Run `touch /etc/fake_file.txt` (With default configuration) in your terminal. At the same time, review the `/var/lib/fim/events.json` file. It will store each produced event in JSON format.
Remove the file with `rm /etc/fake_file.txt`. A new event should appear.

*Produce event in FIM Windows*
Run `echo TEST > C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\fake_file.txt` in your terminal (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with the user you are running). At the same time, review the `C:\ProgramData\fim\events.json` file. It will store each produced event in JSON format.
Remove the file with `rm C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\fake_file.txt`. A new event should appear.
